# Cool Sentence Game

## Vision Statement

The **Cool Sentence Game** is a tool intended to improve cognitive skills that may have been impaired by aging or dementia in older adults. It is recommended to be used daily for a better result. The user will be given a sentence or string of words, and after some time elapses, the sentence will disappear. Then the user will have to recreate the sentence. The tool will track a variety of data that the user can reference, including scores, total time played, and average time taken to finish a level of the game. 

Games will involve users being shown a sentence (or, as difficulty increases, more abstract strings of words) which will then be scrambled after a small period. The words will be enclosed in small boxes that the user can tap on to reconstruct the sentence back to its original form. The user will earn a higher score based on how quickly and how accurately they reconstruct the sentence. 

If the user consents for the app to track and use their data, the system will track how long the user is actively using the app, which is measured by time spent in the game. It will also measure how long the user took to complete a game and track their average time overall. Additionally, a score based on how accurate the user was in reconstructing the sentence will be kept. All of these will be viewable in both numerical and graphical forms. 

Users will be able to see their past data and based on that data, the user can get a sense of how well they are doing. Users can choose the period for which they want to compare the data of (for example weekly data, monthly data, etc.) 

A study conducted by Dr. Zahra Moussavi at the biomedical engineering lab of the University of Manitoba has shown that this game, alongside others, called “Mindtriggers” has been proven to be beneficial for those suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia. However, that series of games is only available on the iOS System. By designing a similar game on Android, this project would increase the number of potential users, allowing more people to access those benefits. 

The game will be considered successful if either a user's memory improves, or the decline in memory slows down. Standardized tests such as WMS-IV and ADAS-Cog can be used for base line assessment of patients and the follow up assessment after they use tools such as this game to train their cognitive skills to test and illustrate the effectiveness of this game.
